The dataset is taken from Kaggle ([link here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidcariboo/player-scores/data)).

There are many files available. You can load them running the script data/load_data.py, which will store the desired file in the data folder.

Recall that Transkermarkt relies on user-contributed data, so it can be biased. 

We have loaded 'transfers.csv' and 'clubs.csv' so far.
