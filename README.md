# football_transfermarkt

The dataset is taken from Kaggle ([link here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidcariboo/player-scores/data)).

There are many files available, I have loaded 'transfers.csv' and 'clubs.csv' so far. For more information about data see the README in the data folder.

In eda.py there is the flow of an explorative data analysis of the dataset transfer.csv. Useful functions and packages import are in utils.py. In test_utils.py there are simple tests for functions written in utils.py. Interesting points of data analysis are progressively written in a file called EDA.txt, contained in results/other/. Plots generated by data analysis are automatically saved in results/figures/.

There is also the file ask_llama.py, which contains a query addressed to Llama aiming to get some analysis suggestions we can perform on our dataset. The result of the query is in the file results/other/llama_suggestions.txt.
