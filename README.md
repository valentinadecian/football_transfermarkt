# football_transfermarkt

The dataset is taken from Kaggle ([link here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidcariboo/player-scores/data)).

There are many files available, I have loaded 'transfers.csv' and 'clubs.csv' so far. For more information about data see the README in the data folder.

In eda.py there is the flow of a (very preliminary) explorative data analysis of the dataset transfer.csv. Useful functions and packages import are in utils.py. In test_utils.py there are simple tests for functions written in utils.py. Plots generated by data analysis are automatically saved in results/figures/.
